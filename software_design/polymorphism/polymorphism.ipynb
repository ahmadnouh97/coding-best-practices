    "## Explanation of Polymorphism in the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Base Class Payment:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This is the superclass with an abstract method `process_payment()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The method raises a `NotImplementedError` to ensure subclasses implement this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Subclasses (CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, BitcoinPayment):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Each subclass inherits from `Payment` and provides its own implementation of the `process_payment()` method.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - This means each payment method (Credit Card, PayPal, Bitcoin) can process payments in its own way.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphic Function `make_payment`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This function takes a `Payment` object and an amount.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - It calls the `process_payment()` method on the `Payment` object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Thanks to polymorphism, the correct method for the specific payment type (Credit Card, PayPal, Bitcoin) is called, even though `make_payment` uses a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Creating Instances and Processing Payments:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Instances of different payment methods are created.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `make_payment` is called with different payment method objects.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The appropriate `process_payment()` method for each payment method is executed, demonstrating polymorphism in action."

    "- **Flexibility:** Easily introduce new payment methods by simply creating a subclass, without the need for widespread code changes.\n",

    "- **Code Reusability:** The `make_payment` function can seamlessly handle any payment method, reducing redundancy and promoting clean code practices.\n",

    "- **Maintainability:** Maintain an organized and comprehensible codebase, enhancing long-term manageability and adaptability.\n",
